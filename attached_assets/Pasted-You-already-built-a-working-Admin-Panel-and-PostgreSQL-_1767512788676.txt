You already built a working Admin Panel and PostgreSQL database for the "LoonCamp" project.

CURRENT STATUS (IMPORTANT CONTEXT):
- Admin panel (React) is fully functional
- Admin can create, update, delete properties
- All changes correctly persist in PostgreSQL
- Backend APIs are working
- Admin panel uses protected APIs (JWT)
- This is CONFIRMED working

PROBLEM TO SOLVE:
- The public website (user-facing site) is NOT connected to the backend/database
- Changes made in admin panel are NOT reflected on the public website
- The public website is currently using static or mock data

GOAL:
- Connect the public website to the SAME backend and SAME PostgreSQL database
- Public website must display LIVE data from database
- Any admin action (add/edit/delete/enable/disable) must reflect immediately on the website
- NO admin functionality should be accessible to public users

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- Use the EXISTING Node.js + PostgreSQL backend
- Do NOT duplicate databases
- Do NOT duplicate APIs
- Do NOT create a second backend
- Public website must consume READ-ONLY APIs
- No authentication required for public users
- Admin routes must remain protected by JWT

ARCHITECTURE REQUIREMENTS:
- One backend
- One PostgreSQL database
- Two frontends:
  1) Admin Panel (protected)
  2) Public Website (read-only)

PUBLIC WEBSITE REQUIREMENTS:

DATA SOURCE:
- Fetch all property data from backend API
- Use ONLY public APIs
- NO direct DB access from frontend

PUBLIC APIs TO USE / CREATE:
- GET /api/properties/public-list
  - Returns ONLY properties where is_active = true
  - Sorted by:
    - Top selling first
    - Latest updated next

OPTIONAL (for detail pages):
- GET /api/properties/:slug
  - Returns single active property with images

PUBLIC WEBSITE FEATURES:
- List Campings
- List Cottages
- List Villas
- Show property images
- Show amenities, highlights, activities, policies
- Show price, capacity, location
- Show only ACTIVE properties
- Automatically reflect admin changes without refresh delay

LIVE UPDATE BEHAVIOR:
- No caching on backend responses
- Use fresh API fetch on page load
- Optional polling or re-fetch on navigation
- Changes in admin panel must reflect immediately on public site

SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:
- Public APIs must NEVER expose:
  - admin emails
  - password hashes
  - inactive properties
- Public users must NOT be able to:
  - add
  - edit
  - delete
  - toggle status
- Admin APIs must remain JWT-protected

FRONTEND REQUIREMENTS (PUBLIC SITE):
- Use React
- Replace all static/mock data with API-based data
- Central API service layer (fetch/axios)
- Handle loading & error states gracefully
- Clean UI separation between admin & public

BACKEND REQUIREMENTS:
- Reuse existing controllers where possible
- Create a clean public controller if needed
- Ensure JSON fields are parsed properly before response
- Ensure response shape matches frontend needs

DELIVERABLES REQUIRED:
1) Public API endpoints wired to database
2) Public website updated to consume live data
3) Clear separation between admin APIs and public APIs
4) README section explaining:
   - How admin changes reflect on website
   - Which APIs are admin-only vs public
   - How to test live updates

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- DO NOT rebuild the admin panel
- DO NOT change database schema
- DO NOT introduce new authentication for public users
- Keep architecture clean and scalable
- This setup must support future features like bookings and payments

FINAL GOAL:
Admin panel controls the data.
Public website reflects it live.
Users can only view and book.
Admins can manage everything securely.
